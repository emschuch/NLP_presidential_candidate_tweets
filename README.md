# Candidential Tweets

This is the code for a simple Spyre web application which conducts text analysis on tweets of the 2016 US presidential candidates.

You can see this web app in action [on my website](http://www.emilyschuch.com/works/candidential-tweets/), and read about how it was made [on my blog](http://emschuch.github.io/Web-App-and-NLP/).
