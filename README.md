# Candidential Tweets

This is the code for a simple Spyre web application which conducts text analysis on tweets of the 2016 US presidential candidates.

You can see this web app in action [on my website](http://www.emilyschuch.com/works/candidential-tweets/), and read about how it was made [on my blog](http://emschuch.github.io/Web-App-and-NLP/).

Find out more about Spyre [here](https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre).

This was my fourth project for the Metis data science bootcamp.

Technologies used:
* Python
* NLP (natural language processing) for sentiment analysis
* Spyre
* Amazon Web Services
* tmux

In addition, I explored other technologies which didn't make it into the final implementation of the app including:
* MongoDB
* Topic modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
* word2vec
* Clustering (kmeans, DBSCAN, and others)
* Heroku
